# Analyzing the Impact of West Asian Economic Indicators on India's GDP Growth
This project aims to analyze the impact and
influence of economic indicators from West Asian countries on
India's GDP growth. By employing linear regression and more
advanced LSTM and BiLSTM models, along with machine
learning models such as Random Forest and Gradient
Boosting, we seek to assess predictive performance and explore
potential improvements in modeling India's GDP growth. The
data used in this research is sourced from the World
Development Indicators (WDI) database compiled by the
World Bank.
